# Echo-cancellation
This repository contains the code of our recently proposed modulation domain acoustic echo cancellation.
Echo is the reflections of far-end speech being played out through a loud speaker in an end-to-end communication.
The echo distraction at the microphone is being suppressed significantly through our proposed modulation domain signal processing approach.
